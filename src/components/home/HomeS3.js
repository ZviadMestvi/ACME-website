              We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and
              state are feeling uneasy about the future - we're not sure what
              the future holds either.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you
              need for your adventures, and we're going to keep doing that -
              with our team - until the city tells us we can't.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around
              the city, then we'll be here â€” every day, making sure your orders
              arrive on time.
